### Overview

An interactive mobile app for children who struggle with sharing their feelings. Created for a local family therapist office, children can go on safari, helping game characters tackle issues with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression and Anger. All 120+ questions were developed through consultation with a practicing mental health therapist. Also worked with an independent designer for all the animal illustrations and sourced copy-right free audio.
